"""Brand-safety AUDIT TRAIL for a content calendar — Evidence-Ledger Step 3c (calendar).

The SAME shape as the verified poster trail (`poster/audit.py`), per item:
  * `shipped_copy` — the (claim -> REAL source URL) trail of the item's surviving
    hook/angle/topic, via `EvidenceLedger.audit_fields(...).export()`. Resolution is the
    SAME language-aware resolver the poster uses (Arabic claim cites Arabic evidence; an
    unavoidable cross-language match is flagged) — so the calendar does not reintroduce the
    visual-match defect fixed on the poster.
  * `remediation` — what the strategy gate BLANKED on this item (recorded at build time), so
    a reader sees the item's hook/angle was fabricated and remediated and that the item now
    runs on its sourced `topic` — not that the hook silently vanished.
And one top-level `coverage` scoping block (shared with the poster): covered = poster +
calendar copy; excluded = reel (NOT yet gated). Pure/deterministic, never raises.
