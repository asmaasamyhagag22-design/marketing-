"""ONE-SHOT designed poster — PILOT (step ب of the TrendPulse `media/` review, 2026-07-03).

TrendPulse's posters look "designed" because a Gemini IMAGE model composes the WHOLE creative —
layout + typography + graphics — in one shot, instead of our photo + HTML text overlay. Our
overlay architecture exists because Imagen garbles Arabic; the nano-banana-class Gemini image
models render text far better — but "better" is a claim to MEASURE, not assume.

This module is the pilot + its FIDELITY GATE. It is NOT wired into the poster pipeline:
`benchmark/measure_oneshot_poster.py` measures Arabic/English verbatim-text fidelity first
(rule 2), and only a measured pass earns it a pipeline mode.

GROUNDING: the text the model is asked to render is OUR already-Ledger-gated copy, passed
VERBATIM. The new risk is the model ALTERING/garbling that copy inside the image — so every
render is verified: a vision model reads the rendered image back and `text_fidelity` compares
what was rendered against what was requested (Arabic-aware normalization). A render that fails
the gate must never ship.

Vertex notes (probed live 2026-07-03 on project image-498715): `gemini-3-pro-image-preview` and
`gemini-3.1-flash-image-preview` resolve ONLY on location="global"; `gemini-2.5-flash-image`
also works on us-central1.
