"""Creative Concept layer — ONE coherent campaign idea drives every element.

Root-cause fix (per the build brief): the poster used to generate the headline, the chips,
and the image INDEPENDENTLY → three unrelated things, no single message, often English on an
Arabic brand. Now a single LLM call produces a structured `CreativeConcept` (audience,
single_message, core_benefit, tone, visual_idea, proof_points) AND the customer-facing COPY
(headline / subheadline / cta / chips) built FROM that one message, in the BRAND'S language.

Hard rules enforced here:
  * LANGUAGE LOCK — for an Arabic brand, every visible copy field must be Arabic with ZERO
    Latin characters. A regex validator rejects any `[A-Za-z]`; we regenerate (stricter
    prompt) up to N times before giving up to a grounded Arabic fallback. (Brief Step B.)
  * AD COPY, not a mission statement — headline is 2–6 words selling a benefit. (Step D.)
  * Chips come ONLY from the concept's proof_points, in consumer language. (Step E.)
  * GROUNDED — the concept is conditioned on the scraped profile (facts) + the BrandCreativeDNA
    (tone/style). It never invents prices/claims; copy is brand-voice paraphrase (design domain).

Side-effect free (caller injected). Degrades: no caller → a grounded fallback concept from the
profile. Never raises for ordinary failures.
