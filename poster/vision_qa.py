"""Vision QA gate — a REAL self-critique that rejects and triggers regeneration.

Per the build brief (Step H): after rendering the FINAL poster, a vision model inspects the
actual rendered image and returns a structured verdict. On fail the pipeline regenerates
(bounded retries); if it still fails it returns a CLEAR ERROR, never a broken poster.

Checks (on the rendered poster, not just the background):
  * has_latin_text   — Latin letters in the HEADLINE / CHIPS / CTA (the brand LOGO is exempt)
  * cta_clipped      — the CTA / any element cut off at the frame edge
  * on_brand_color   — the dominant colour matches the brand (e.g. WE = purple), not random
  * candid_violation — candid/documentary look or flat natural lighting when the brand DNA
                       forbids it
  * overall_pass + reason

Side-effect free (multimodal caller injected). Degrades: no caller → a permissive PASS with a
note (we can't gate without vision). Never raises.
