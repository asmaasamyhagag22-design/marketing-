"""Brand-safety AUDIT TRAIL for a generated poster — Evidence-Ledger Step 3c.

The agency-facing PROOF object. For ONE poster it carries:
  1. `final_copy`  — the (claim -> REAL source URL) trail of the SHIPPED copy, via
     `EvidenceLedger.audit_fields(...).export()`. Source URLs are the actual scraped
     `page_url`s the evidence came from (not placeholders).
  2. `remediation` — what the grounding gate CAUGHT and how it was HANDLED (softened /
     dropped / softened_to_fallback). This is the transparency that makes the proof
     HONEST: the agency sees the system caught and remediated a fabrication, not merely
     that the result looks clean. The original fabricated claim is shown ONLY here, marked
     handled — never in `final_copy` as if it were sourced, and never hidden as if it
     never existed.
  3. `coverage`   — an EXPLICIT scoping statement: which surfaces this trail covers vs which
     are excluded (the reel is NOT yet gated, so no brand-safety claim is made for it).
     Claiming coverage for an ungated surface would be the overselling that breaks the moat.

Pure/deterministic, never raises for ordinary input.
