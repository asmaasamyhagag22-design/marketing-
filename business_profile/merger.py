"""Profile merger.

Combines a rules-only BusinessProfile with a ValidatedPayload from the
LLM validator. The output is the final, full BusinessProfile with
recomputed quality and updated extraction_meta.

Per-field merge policy (explicit, deterministic):

| Field | Source winner when both present |
|---|---|
| name              | rules (schema.org > og:site_name > title > h1). LLM never overrides. |
| tagline           | LLM only (rules can't synthesize one) |
| description       | LLM only (rules can't synthesize one) |
| category          | rules if schema.org-sourced; otherwise LLM |
| offerings         | LLM only |
| pricing_visible   | rules only (boolean from currency regex) |
| pricing_posture   | LLM only |
| audience_type     | LLM only |
| audience_signals  | LLM only |
| value_propositions| LLM only |
| tone_of_voice     | LLM only |
| trust_signals     | LLM only |
| service_areas     | LLM only |
| locations         | rules (schema.org). LLM doesn't extract these. |
| hours             | rules (schema.org). LLM doesn't extract these. |
| contact_channels  | rules (pure manifest passthrough). LLM doesn't touch. |
| existing_ctas     | rules (from manifest.links.cta_candidates) |
| social_presence   | rules (from manifest.links.social) |
| visual            | rules (pure manifest passthrough) |
| languages         | rules (from manifest.languages) |

The merger is the last gate. If you want to change priority, change
the policy here — not anywhere upstream.
