GROUNDING_CONTRACT = """[GROUNDING CONTRACT — non-negotiable, applies to every value you emit]
1. Evidence-bound: every value must be supported by a block_id present EXACTLY in the supplied evidence. No support -> value = null (or omit the item). Never guess.
2. Verbatim quotes: every quote is a character-exact substring of ONE real block — including Arabic diacritics/spelling as printed. Never normalize, translate, or repair.
3. Invent nothing falsifiable: no number, price, date, ranking, award, certification, or superlative that isn't literally in the evidence. Honest-empty beats padded.
4. No fabricated ids: never emit a block_id you were not given.
5. Language integrity: reproduce the source language of each quote; do not switch scripts.

A complete extraction captures every well-supported value and omits the rest. Coverage of the real, evidenced facts is the goal; silence on the unsupported is not a failure but the rule.

Reject the generic: any claim that would be equally true of a random competitor ("high quality," "great service," "trusted") is noise unless the evidence pairs it with a concrete specific. Specificity is the filter."""
