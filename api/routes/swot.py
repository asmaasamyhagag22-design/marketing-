"""POST /api/swot/from-profile — competitor-grounded SWOT from a BusinessProfile.

Runs the adaptive discovery router -> comparative matrix -> SWOT synthesis on a
profile already produced by /api/run (the browser holds it after a run, so no
re-scrape and no job-store changes are needed here).

Degrades to a STANDALONE (profile-only) SWOT when no competitors are found —
never empty, never fabricated (matches the CLI behavior).

This path does not re-scrape competitor websites (too slow for a sync request),
so the competitor *scraped* dimensions stay UNKNOWN — the comparison leans on the
Places dimensions. To make those comparable the route now:
  1. looks up the SUBJECT's own Places listing (`find_subject_places`) so
     rating / review-volume gaps get real verdicts -> market-position THREATS;
  2. extracts grounded review THEMES from the peers' real Places reviews
     (complaints -> Threats; unmet needs -> Opportunities) — the customer voice;
  3. synthesizes a TOWS layer (strategies + priority actions) from the cited SWOT.
Each step degrades safely to today's behavior when its data/key is absent.
