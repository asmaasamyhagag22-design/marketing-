"""Vision QA for a GENERATED reel scene — rejects Veo image-to-video hallucinations.

The owner watched a real render and caught three failures the prompt alone can't stop
(Veo drifts away from the seed over a few seconds): the product is NOT faithful to the
real photo, it performs an IMPOSSIBLE action (pressing a sealed pump), and it "magically"
VANISHES mid-scene. A system prompt asks Veo not to do these; it does them anyway.

So we inspect the actual clip: extract a few frames, hand them (plus the REAL product photo
as the reference) to a vision model, and get a structured verdict. On fail the compositor
regenerates the scene once, then falls back to a FAITHFUL real-photo KenBurns pass — so the
worst case still shows the true product instead of a hallucinated one.

Degrades: no caller -> a permissive pass with checked=False (we can't gate without vision).
Never raises."""
