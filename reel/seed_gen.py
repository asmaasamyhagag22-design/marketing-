"""FULLY-GENERATED reel scenes (owner creative ruling, 2026-07-12).

Real photos EXIT the display path — no raw site photo appears inside a reel. Their role
EXPANDS instead: they become (a) GENERATION CONDITIONING — every scene seed is generated
9:16, conditioned on the brand's real place/product photos (the poster's C2 REAL-PLACE
mechanism), the BrandCreativeDNA style and the evidence-derived locale — and (b) JUDGING
REFERENCES — motion-QA's place-fidelity verdict still judges the generated world AGAINST
the real photo; the reference just stopped being visible.

SCOPE BOUNDARY (defense-critical): this covers REEL SCENES — an EXPRESSIVE surface,
generated-but-grounded. It does NOT touch evidence surfaces: real product photos in
commerce posters, composited real logos, verbatim copy. "Real stays real" remains the law
there. Anti-hallucination stays fully armed here (seed gate -> motion QA -> place
fidelity) — that stack is what makes "generated" different from "invented".

Generator: the same gemini-image call the poster one-shot uses (quota-aware retries
included) — Imagen edit models are not enabled on this project (measured 404).
Fail-closed: a seed that fails the art-critic gate twice falls back to the REAL photo via
the legacy blur-contain path (never ship a bad generated frame just to obey a style rule).
