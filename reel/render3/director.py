R1 ONE PROTAGONIST. Exactly one character is the visual subject of EVERY shot.
   Supporting people (instructor, colleague) may appear but never replace the
   protagonist as the subject of a shot.
R2 THREE-ACT ARC across {n_shots} shots (default 6, 4-6 s each):
   Act1 = tension (a real, visible problem), Act2 = turning point + effort,
   Act3 = transformation + payoff + CTA. Every shot carries a story_function
   and an emotion. The beat "person smiles at a laptop/phone" is BANNED
   everywhere except as the single final payoff shot.
R3 ONE MOTIF. One physical object appears in every shot and visibly evolves
   with the arc (define its state per act). The motif is the visual glue.
R4 COLOR SCRIPT. A deliberate 3-act palette progression (2 hex anchors + grade
   words per act) plus constants (lens, depth of field, lighting style, grain).
   Deliberate progression = thread; random jumps = noise.
R5 MATCH CUTS. For every consecutive shot pair, specify match_cut_out: how
   shot k ENDS (gesture / object / camera direction) so that shot k+1's
   opening visually continues it.
R6 SCREENS. screen_rule must be exactly one of these tokens:
   (a) NONE — no screen in this shot (default),
   (b) OUT_OF_FOCUS — content unreadable by design (bokeh glow only),
   (c) ANGLED_AWAY — screen not facing camera,
   (d) REAL_CONTENT:<desc> — name the exact mundane content (e.g. "dark
       terminal window, a few lines of white monospace text" / "network
       topology diagram with 5 labeled nodes").
   NEVER "futuristic interface", NEVER glowing abstract UI, NEVER implied text.
R7 CHARACTER SHEET SPEC. A complete physical description FROZEN for the whole
   reel: name, age, presenting_gender ("man" or "woman" — must match the
   protagonist), skin tone, face shape + exactly 2 distinctive facial features,
   eyes, hijab yes/no (a man has hijab null; if a woman wears one: exact color +
   pattern + wrap style), max 2 outfits (Act1 outfit, Act3 outfit — both
   precise), and one constant accessory tied to the motif.
R8 VO. One voice, Egyptian Arabic, 60-70 words, first person, matching the
   arc. Aim for ~65 words — COUNT the words before answering; short scripts
   are rejected. Every factual claim in the VO must trace to a bullet in
   EVIDENCE. If a claim is not in EVIDENCE, do not make it."""
