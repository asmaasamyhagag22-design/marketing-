"""Creative reel orchestration: Opus director -> Veo 3.1 -> voice-over.

Ties the pieces into the "complete reel" the user asked for:
  1. Opus (vision) designs the reel from the identity + real photos
     (reel.creative_director) — per-scene Veo prompts + voice-over + captions.
  2. Each scene's REAL photo is seeded into Veo 3.1 image-to-video with Opus's
     cinematic motion prompt (so the motion happens INSIDE the real scene).
  3. The voice-over lines are synthesized (reel.voiceover) into a timed track and
     muxed under the visuals (with optional music ducked beneath).

The visuals stay grounded in the brand's real photos; only the motion + narration
are generated. Honest-degrades: no Opus key -> caller should fall back to the
deterministic storyboard; no TTS key -> the reel renders without narration.
