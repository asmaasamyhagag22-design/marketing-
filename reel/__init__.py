"""Reel Studio — turn a BusinessProfile into a vertical marketing reel (1080x1920).

The natural extension of the Poster Studio: where the poster uses Imagen for a
still + an HTML/CSS overlay, the reel uses **Veo** for the moving visual + an
**ffmpeg/libass** overlay. Same two hard rules carry over:

  * ZERO HALLUCINATION — every overlaid word (logo / headline / offering / CTA /
    contact) is VERBATIM scraped evidence selected from the profile, or omitted.
    The reel reuses the poster's verbatim selectors as the single source of truth.
  * TEXT-FREE VISUAL + VERBATIM OVERLAY — Veo generates the scene with NO text
    (it garbles Arabic, exactly like Imagen — poster decisions §5); all text is
    overlaid afterward by libass, which shapes Arabic RTL correctly.

Pipeline:  profile -> build_reel_brief -> build_storyboard -> VideoProvider
           (Veo | stub) per scene -> ffmpeg compositor (crossfade + RTL subtitle
           overlay + logo + music) -> .mp4

Verifiable offline via StubVideoProvider (brand-palette animated gradients), so
the whole pipeline runs here without Google credentials — live Veo runs in GCP.
