"""Vision-based selection of the brand's REAL photos for the reel.

The scraper collects every on-page image; many are NOT footage you'd put in a
marketing reel — partner/sponsor logos (Microsoft, AWS, ...), QR codes, icons,
diagrams, text banners, screenshots. Animating those is the "زوّم على QR code"
bug. URL/extension heuristics can't tell a partner logo from a real photo, so we
SHOW each image to a vision model together with the business identity and keep
only real, on-brand PHOTOGRAPHS of THIS business (its space, people, work, food,
products). Honest-degrade: if no key/SDK/network, return the input unchanged.
