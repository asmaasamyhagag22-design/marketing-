"""BrandCreativeDNA — learn a brand's REAL visual design language from its own creatives.

Owner's insight: the poster looked like a fixed template because we only ever fed the
model COLORS + fonts. The fix is to let the model SEE the brand's actual posters/ads and
reverse-engineer HOW they think visually — composition, hierarchy, typographic character,
imagery, signature moves — then design each new creative in that language (different every
time, unmistakably on-brand).

Pipeline (once per brand, cached):
  1) HARVEST  — image-search the brand's real marketing creatives (Serper images) + reuse
                its scraped on-page photos.
  2) UNDERSTAND — ONE multimodal Gemini 2.5 Pro call that SEES those creatives and emits a
                structured `BrandCreativeDNA` (the brand's design "how", not just its hex).
  3) PERSIST  — save the DNA so the poster/reel read it instead of re-deriving每 run.

GROUNDING / HONESTY: the DNA is pure DESIGN judgement over what the model SEES — it states
no factual claims (facts stay in the validated profile). We LEARN design principles from the
brand's creatives; we never reproduce them. Side-effect free (caller + provider injected;
no .env / os.environ mutation), same discipline as brand_book.py / poster/brand_research.py.
Degrades gracefully: no provider -> website photos only; no caller -> a profile-only stub;
no images -> text-only note. Never raises for ordinary failures.
