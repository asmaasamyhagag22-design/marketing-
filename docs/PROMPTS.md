# Project Prompt Catalog

> **Every LLM / image / vision prompt in this repo, in one place.** Generated from an automated sweep of the codebase, then curated. For each prompt: where it lives (`file:line`, click to open), which model receives it, what kind of prompt it is, what it does, and a short excerpt. **The source file is always the source of truth** — most prompts are *assembled* at call time (f-strings, per-vertical fragments, grounding facts spliced in), so the excerpts below are representative, not byte-exact.

**54 prompts** across **5 subsystems.**

## How prompting works in this system

Two separate **truth domains**, on purpose:

- **The LLM designs** — it writes concepts, copy, scene plans, strategies. Creative freedom lives here.
- **Code renders + validates** — the Evidence Ledger and deterministic gates decide what is allowed to ship. Facts are never taken on the model's word.

So a single deliverable (a poster, a reel) passes through *several* prompts of different kinds:

| Kind | Role |
|------|------|
| **system** | Sets the model's job + hard rules for a whole call |
| **user** | Supplies the grounding facts for one specific call |
| **template fragment** | A per-vertical / per-run piece spliced into a larger prompt |
| **feedback / instructions** | Regeneration feedback appended on a retry when a gate fails |
| **retrieval intent** | An embedded query string used to *select* evidence (RAG), not sent as chat |

Models in play: **Gemini 2.5** (Pro for the heavy extraction/strategy calls, Flash for cheap judges) is the production default; **Anthropic** (Opus for the reel director, Sonnet for the domain-schema + review-theme calls); **Gemini image + vision** models for poster render and read-back QA; **Gemini `text-embedding-004`** for RAG; **OpenAI** callers as a drop-in fallback and `gpt-audio` for reel voice-over. All text calls go through one `Caller` protocol, so any provider is swappable and tests inject a `MockCaller`.

## 1. Business Profile — evidence-grounded extraction

Turns scraped page blocks into a structured brand profile. Every extraction call shares one strict system prompt that forbids any value without a verbatim `block_id` citation — this is the first grounding wall. Four grouped user prompts (identity / offerings / positioning / trust) each get only the RAG-selected evidence for that group.

### GROUNDING_CONTRACT

- **Where:** [`business_profile/llm/prompts.py`:29](https://github.com/asmaasamyhagag22-design/marketing-/blob/main/business_profile/llm/prompts.py#L29)
- **Kind:** system (canonical block, injected into SYSTEM_PROMPT)
- **Model:** shared across all four groups (Gemini 2.5 default / OpenAI fallback)
- **Does:** THE single source of the grounding rules — stated once and injected into SYSTEM_PROMPT instead of nine drifting copies. Five non-negotiable rules (evidence-bound + null-when-unsupported, verbatim quotes incl. Arabic, invent-nothing-falsifiable, no fabricated ids, language integrity) + a positive coverage line + the lifted anti-cliché specificity rule.

> [GROUNDING CONTRACT — non-negotiable, applies to every value you emit] 1. Evidence-bound: every value must be supported by a block_id present EXACTLY in the supplied evidence. No support -> value = null. Never guess. 2. Verbatim quotes: character-exact substring of ONE real block — including Arabic diacritics/spelling. 3. Invent nothing falsifiable... 4. No fabricated ids. 5. Language integrity... Coverage of the real, evidenced facts is the goal... Reject the generic... Specificity is the filter.

### SYSTEM_PROMPT

- **Where:** [`business_profile/llm/prompts.py`:48](https://github.com/asmaasamyhagag22-design/marketing-/blob/main/business_profile/llm/prompts.py#L48)
- **Kind:** system
- **Model:** Gemini 2.5 (GeminiCaller, default) or OpenAI gpt-4o-mini (OpenAICaller) via run_llm_extraction
- **Does:** Shared system prompt for all four grouped extraction calls; embeds GROUNDING_CONTRACT verbatim + OPERATING NOTES (may-emit-inferred-if-cited, quotes under 200 chars).

> You are a business profile extractor... [GROUNDING CONTRACT ...] ... OPERATING NOTES: - You may emit a value INFERRED from copy... only if you cite the blocks... - Keep quotes short (under 200 characters)...

### build_identity_prompt

- **Where:** [`business_profile/llm/prompts.py`:58](https://github.com/asmaasamyhagag22-design/marketing-/blob/main/business_profile/llm/prompts.py#L58)
- **Kind:** user
- **Model:** Gemini 2.5 / OpenAI via Caller (group='identity', IdentityResponse)
- **Does:** Builds the identity-group user prompt (inherits GROUNDING_CONTRACT): tagline (COPY verbatim, don't compose), description (COMPOSE from evidence, every claim traces to a block_id), and one hardened category from the fixed enum ('other' only when nothing fits, never as a shortcut for 'unsure').

> Extract three identity fields (the GROUNDING CONTRACT governs every value): 1. tagline... copied VERBATIM if one exists; null if none. Copy, don't compose. 2. description: 2-3 sentences you COMPOSE from evidenced facts... Compose, but grounded. 3. category: choose exactly ONE from {enum}... use 'other' only when no listed category genuinely applies.

### build_offerings_prompt

- **Where:** [`business_profile/llm/prompts.py`:276](https://github.com/asmaasamyhagag22-design/marketing-/blob/main/business_profile/llm/prompts.py#L276)
- **Kind:** user
- **Model:** Gemini 2.5 / OpenAI via Caller (group='offerings', OfferingsResponse)
- **Does:** Builds the offerings-group user prompt (inherits GROUNDING_CONTRACT): extract offerings[] (name/short_description/price_text/evidence) + pricing_posture, with a category-aware item cap and the swapped catalog-SHAPE guidance. The prose FORBIDDEN-CLAIMS block was DROPPED (redundant with contract rule 3 + the UNSUBSTANTIATED_CLAIM_TOKENS validator); the own-name ban + honest-empty stay.

> Extract the concrete things this business offers... Prefer SPECIFIC named offerings; if only broad categories exist capture at most 1-2; if nothing concrete is listed, return an EMPTY list — honest-empty beats padding. NEVER emit the business's OWN NAME... Then apply the structural selection rules for THIS catalog shape: {shape} ... PRICING POSTURE: choose one of budget, mid, premium, unknown.

### _CATALOG_SHAPES + _CATEGORY_TO_SHAPE

- **Where:** [`business_profile/llm/prompts.py`:94](https://github.com/asmaasamyhagag22-design/marketing-/blob/main/business_profile/llm/prompts.py#L94)
- **Kind:** template fragment
- **Model:** Gemini 2.5 / OpenAI (one shape injected into build_offerings_prompt, chosen by `_shape_for(rules_category)`)
- **Does:** REPLACES the old 18 per-vertical keys with 4 UNIVERSAL catalog shapes + a category→shape map (process.md rule 5: config keyed by a universal signal, universal default, never vertical names as logic). Shapes: `broad_catalog` (ecommerce/retail — DEPARTMENTS-FIRST, SKU≠offering, breadth), `named_menu` (restaurant/cafe), `programs` (clinic/hospital/education/agency/fitness/gov/… — named service lines), `default` (beauty/other/None/unknown — the adaptive fallback with store-detection). An unknown/None category resolves to `default` BY CONSTRUCTION, so the old fail-open None-key bug is impossible.

> broad_catalog: DEPARTMENTS FIRST... a name with pack size/weight/count/flavor is a SKU — NEVER an offering... breadth over depth... | programs: NAMED SERVICES, PROGRAMS or SPECIALTIES... capture the specific name, not the bare category... | named_menu: the SPECIFIC named items the page lists (verbatim from the menu)... | default: ...IF THE EVIDENCE SHOWS A PRODUCT STORE, apply the broad_catalog HARD RULES.

### build_positioning_prompt

- **Where:** [`business_profile/llm/prompts.py`:346](https://github.com/asmaasamyhagag22-design/marketing-/blob/main/business_profile/llm/prompts.py#L346)
- **Kind:** user
- **Model:** Gemini 2.5 / OpenAI via Caller (group='positioning', PositioningResponse)
- **Does:** Builds the positioning-group user prompt: extract audience_type (enum), audience_signals[], value_propositions[], tone_of_voice (enum), and other_unique_insights[].

> EXTRACT: 1. audience_type: one of B2C, B2B, B2G, mixed, unknown. 2. audience_signals: short phrases... 3. value_propositions: the distinctive promises... Skip generic claims like 'high quality' unless paired with specifics. 4. tone_of_voice... 5. other_unique_insights: a CATCH-ALL for a genuinely UNIQUE competitive edge... each must be a CONCRETE FACT stated on the page (cite block_id + verbatim quote).

### build_trust_prompt

- **Where:** [`business_profile/llm/prompts.py`:373](https://github.com/asmaasamyhagag22-design/marketing-/blob/main/business_profile/llm/prompts.py#L373)
- **Kind:** user
- **Model:** Gemini 2.5 / OpenAI via Caller (group='trust', TrustResponse)
- **Does:** Builds the trust-group user prompt: extract trust_signals[] (certifications, awards, clients, tenure, credentials, testimonials) and service_areas[].

> EXTRACT: 1. trust_signals: concrete proof points that build credibility... certifications... awards... notable clients or partners... tenure... team credentials... testimonials (only when a real quote with attribution is present)... Cap at 8 items. (The old "Skip vague self-praise" was removed — the contract's specificity rule now covers it globally.) 2. service_areas: geographic regions the business explicitly serves... Skip mailing addresses — only places they say they SERVE.

### _GROUP_QUERIES

- **Where:** [`business_profile/llm/rag.py`:64](https://github.com/asmaasamyhagag22-design/marketing-/blob/main/business_profile/llm/rag.py#L64)
- **Kind:** retrieval intent
- **Model:** Gemini text-embedding-004 (embed_texts) — semantic retrieval query, not a chat prompt
- **Does:** Per-group retrieval intent strings embedded and matched against block vectors to select the top-K relevant evidence blocks for each extraction group (identity/offerings/positioning/trust).

> identity: 'What this business is and does: its name, tagline, mission...'; offerings: 'The specific products, services, menu items, courses, programs, packages... including their names, descriptions and prices'; positioning: 'What makes this business distinctive: its value propositions...'; trust: 'Proof of credibility and trust: certifications, awards, accreditations...'

### _PROMPT

- **Where:** [`business_profile/domain_schema.py`:116](https://github.com/asmaasamyhagag22-design/marketing-/blob/main/business_profile/domain_schema.py#L116)
- **Kind:** user
- **Model:** Anthropic (claude-sonnet-4-6) via anthropic.Anthropic().messages.create in build_domain_profile
- **Does:** Standalone prompt asking the Anthropic model to (1) name the business's specific vertical and (2) design + fill 5-8 domain-specific marketing attributes, each with a verbatim evidence_quote, returned as strict JSON. Grounding is code-enforced afterward.

> You are designing a MARKETING-INTELLIGENCE schema for one specific business... Do TWO things: 1. Identify its SPECIFIC vertical — finer than a generic category... 2. Propose the 5-8 domain-specific ATTRIBUTES that matter MOST... Use ONLY the evidence. If an attribute can't be supported by a quote, OMIT it... Return ONLY a JSON object, no prose, no markdown fences.

---

## 2. Poster — concept, copy, image, and the fidelity gate

Two truth domains: an LLM WRITES the concept + brand copy (gated against the Evidence Ledger), then a Gemini IMAGE model RENDERS a finished poster that must print our copy verbatim. A vision OCR read-back + an art-director QA pass reject any render that garbles text, invents labels, or paints the brand name onto objects.

### build_creative_concept (system)

- **Does:** Main Creative-Concept brief: turn brand facts into ONE campaign concept + brand-language copy (headline/sub/cta/proof chips) that all express the same message.

> You are a senior advertising CREATIVE DIRECTOR. From the brand's real facts, craft ONE coherent campaign concept... THE BAR — the STRANGER TEST: a first-time viewer... must, in one glance, say FOUR things: (1) WHO it is; (2) WHAT THEY DO; (3) the SPECIFIC thing on offer; (4) ONE real proof.

- **Model:** Same caller as system prompt (Gemini/OpenAI), group_name="poster_concept_brief"
- **Does:** Supplies the grounding facts (name, tagline, description, offerings, brand tone, fresh web-research facts, trend context, per-run variation cue) for the concept call.

> Brand: {name}\nTagline: {tagline}\nWhat they do: {desc}\nReal offerings (raw, may be internal jargon): ...\nBrand tone/style (from its real creatives): ...\n[research_block][trend_block][vary]\nReturn the structured concept.

- **Kind:** feedback / instructions
- **Model:** Same concept caller (Gemini/OpenAI), re-sent as system+strict_suffix
- **Does:** Copy-critic regeneration feedback appended on retry when copy fails language-lock / empty-proof / CTA-repeats-headline checks.

> REGENERATE and fix ALL of these: <problems> . — e.g. 'there were Latin characters — write headline, subheadline, cta and proof_points 100% in Arabic'; 'subheadline (the دليل/PROOF line) was empty'; 'the cta just repeated the headline'.

### _grounding_problems

- **Where:** [`poster/concept.py`:147](https://github.com/asmaasamyhagag22-design/marketing-/blob/main/poster/concept.py#L147)
- **Kind:** feedback / instructions
- **Model:** Feedback fragment merged into the concept regenerate call (Gemini/OpenAI)
- **Does:** Targeted regenerate feedback for every UNSOURCED falsifiable claim (number/year/certification/superlative) in headline/sub/cta — tells the model to SOFTEN, not invent.

> the {label} "{text}" makes an UNVERIFIABLE claim ({toks}) that is NOT supported by the brand's real facts... SOFTEN it: remove the ranking/number/credential and keep the core message; do NOT invent any replacement number, certification, or superlative

### build_oneshot_prompt

- **Model:** Injected multimodal caller (Gemini vision), group_name="oneshot_ocr"
- **Does:** Asks the vision model to list every visible text element top-to-bottom exactly as printed, preserving Arabic dialectal spellings and dot counts.

> List EVERY piece of text visible in this poster image... copied EXACTLY letter-for-letter as printed. CRITICAL for Arabic: preserve DIALECTAL spellings exactly (if the poster prints أكتر with ت, write أكتر — do NOT 'fix' it to أكثر); count the dots — ت has 2 dots, ث has 3; ة vs ه as printed.

## 3. Reel — Opus creative director, Veo render, scene QA

Opus (vision) designs an N-scene 9:16 ad from the brand's REAL photos on a HOOK → WHAT-IT-IS → BENEFIT → PROOF → CTA spine, writing a Veo motion prompt + voice-over + caption per scene. A deterministic plan-eval catches a weak plan before the expensive render; a vision scene-QA rejects Veo hallucinations after it.

### _system_prompt

- **Where:** [`reel/creative_director.py`:201](https://github.com/asmaasamyhagag22-design/marketing-/blob/main/reel/creative_director.py#L201)
- **Kind:** system
- **Model:** Anthropic Opus (claude-opus-4-8) via design_creative_reel -> client.messages.create(system=...)
- **Does:** Directs Opus to design an N-scene vertical 9:16 ad reel from the identity + real photos, following the HOOK -> WHAT-IT-IS -> BENEFIT -> PROOF -> CTA spine, and return JSON scenes (veo_prompt/voiceover/on_screen_text).

> You are a SENIOR CREATIVE DIRECTOR with 15 years in performance-marketing and TikTok/Reels advertising... Design a {n_scenes}-scene reel that ADVERTISES this brand with the proven AD SPINE... Return ONLY a JSON object, no prose, no markdown fences.

### _MOTION_GUIDANCE

- **Where:** [`reel/creative_director.py`:168](https://github.com/asmaasamyhagag22-design/marketing-/blob/main/reel/creative_director.py#L168)
- **Kind:** template fragment
- **Model:** Anthropic Opus (claude-opus-4-8) — injected into _system_prompt by mode
- **Does:** Per-vertical (beauty/elegant/food/generic) veo_prompt motion-guidance fragment picked by _vertical_mode and spliced into the system prompt so each reel's motion vocabulary fits the brand.

> beauty: '- veo_prompt: a vivid, TikTok-native Veo 3.1 IMAGE-TO-VIDEO prompt where a real PERSON uses THIS exact product: a hand enters frame, picks it up and applies it... and the model REACTS'

### _MOTION_TAIL

- **Where:** [`reel/creative_director.py`:160](https://github.com/asmaasamyhagag22-design/marketing-/blob/main/reel/creative_director.py#L160)
- **Kind:** template fragment
- **Model:** Anthropic Opus (claude-opus-4-8) — appended to every _MOTION_GUIDANCE mode
- **Does:** Shared motion tail appended to every mode's guidance: keep the product identity exact, add the person/action around it, only physically-logical use, real energetic movement (no slow zoom/static pan).

> The product's IDENTITY must stay exactly as shown — same shape, label, colour and proportions... Show only PHYSICALLY LOGICAL use... Real, energetic movement in every second — NOT a slow zoom, NOT a static pan. Add no fake text, logos, or signage.

### _DELIVERY_EG

- **Where:** [`reel/creative_director.py`:193](https://github.com/asmaasamyhagag22-design/marketing-/blob/main/reel/creative_director.py#L193)
- **Kind:** template fragment
- **Model:** Anthropic Opus (claude-opus-4-8) — injected into _system_prompt's voiceover_delivery line
- **Does:** Per-vertical example voiceover_delivery phrases handed to Opus as examples of the emotion/performance note to write for each scene's narration.

> beauty: 'fresh and upbeat', 'confident glow', 'delighted reaction', 'warm friendly invitation'; elegant: 'hushed reverence', 'quiet confidence'...

### _system_prompt (featured/whole-brand branch)

- **Where:** [`reel/creative_director.py`:205](https://github.com/asmaasamyhagag22-design/marketing-/blob/main/reel/creative_director.py#L205)
- **Kind:** template fragment
- **Model:** Anthropic Opus (claude-opus-4-8)
- **Does:** Featured-vs-whole-brand variant text inside _system_prompt: when featured_product is set, forces every scene onto REAL PHOTO index 0 (same product, varied shots); otherwise anchors on one hero product across distinct photos.

> FEATURED PRODUCT: {featured}. This reel advertises ONLY this product — EVERY scene is the SAME product (REAL PHOTO index 0), varied by SHOT and ACTION... NEVER a different product.

### design_creative_reel

- **Where:** [`reel/creative_director.py`:372](https://github.com/asmaasamyhagag22-design/marketing-/blob/main/reel/creative_director.py#L372)
- **Kind:** user
- **Model:** Anthropic Opus (claude-opus-4-8) — user message with image blocks
- **Does:** Builds the user turn sent to Opus: the business identity brief (_identity_block, line 60) + an optional FEATURED PRODUCT note (feat, line 370) + the downscaled real-photo image blocks, then asks it to design the reel.

> BUSINESS IDENTITY:\n{identity} ... You have {len(used)} real photos below. Design the reel.  / feat: 'FEATURED PRODUCT (advertise ONLY this): {featured_product}. Every scene is the SAME product below — vary the shot/action, not the item.'

### _instructions_for

- **Where:** [`reel/voiceover.py`:40](https://github.com/asmaasamyhagag22-design/marketing-/blob/main/reel/voiceover.py#L40)
- **Kind:** feedback / instructions
- **Model:** OpenAI gpt-audio-1.5 (chat.completions system msg) / gpt-4o-mini-tts (instructions param); also prepended to Gemini TTS content
- **Does:** Builds the TTS performance/delivery brief: one consistent human narrator, tone-adaptive (luxury=refined/unhurried, playful=bright/energetic, else warm), Egyptian-Arabic read when Arabic text is detected, plus a per-passage emotional direction appended from `delivery`.

> You are ONE consistent, professional human voice-over artist narrating a premium brand film. Keep the SAME voice, character and energy from the first word to the last... Perform it {mood}. Never flat, never robotic, never a news anchor.

### check_scene (system)

- **Where:** [`reel/scene_qa.py`:106](https://github.com/asmaasamyhagag22-design/marketing-/blob/main/reel/scene_qa.py#L106)
- **Kind:** system
- **Model:** Vision model via injected `caller(system, user, _QAResponse, group_name='reel_scene_qa', images=...)`
- **Does:** Strict vision-QA/judge prompt: inspects extracted clip frames against the real product reference photo and returns a structured verdict on product_faithful / product_persists / action_plausible / overall_pass with a reason.

> You are a STRICT quality reviewer for a short product ad clip... product_faithful: do the clip frames show the SAME product as the reference... product_persists: is the product clearly visible in EVERY clip frame... action_plausible: is every depicted action physically possible... overall_pass = product_faithful AND product_persists AND action_plausible.

### check_scene (user)

- **Where:** [`reel/scene_qa.py`:121](https://github.com/asmaasamyhagag22-design/marketing-/blob/main/reel/scene_qa.py#L121)
- **Kind:** user
- **Model:** Vision model via injected `caller`
- **Does:** The user turn paired with the QA system prompt, instructing the model to compare the clip to the reference and emit the structured verdict.

> Review the clip against the reference and return the structured verdict.

## 5. Grounding — the same-subject judge

The Evidence Ledger's last-resort residual check: when a marketing claim and brand evidence share a token, a cheap Gemini judge decides only whether they describe the SAME thing (accept synonyms, reject unrelated subjects), biased to accept when unsure.

### _SYSTEM (module constant; consumed by make_subject_judge -> judge)

- **Where:** [`grounding/subject_judge.py`:19](https://github.com/asmaasamyhagag22-design/marketing-/blob/main/grounding/subject_judge.py#L19)
- **Kind:** system
- **Model:** Gemini cheap/Flash caller (default_caller(strong=False), e.g. gemini-2.5-flash); invoked as caller(_SYSTEM, user, _SameSubject, group_name="ledger_subject_judge") from the EvidenceLedger C2 ambiguous-case gate
- **Does:** System prompt for the Evidence Ledger's C2-residual 'same-subject' judge: given a value/word shared by BOTH a marketing claim and brand evidence, decide ONLY whether it describes the SAME thing (accept synonyms/inflections, reject unrelated subjects), biased to accept when unsure.

> You check a marketing CLAIM against a brand's REAL evidence. The shared value (a number, or a ranking/superlative word) already appears in BOTH — decide ONLY whether it describes the SAME THING. ... same_subject=false (reject): the value is about an UNRELATED thing ... When genuinely unsure, answer true — never block a plausibly-real claim.

### judge (nested closure inside make_subject_judge)

- **Where:** [`grounding/subject_judge.py`:47](https://github.com/asmaasamyhagag22-design/marketing-/blob/main/grounding/subject_judge.py#L47)
- **Kind:** user
- **Model:** Gemini cheap/Flash caller (same call as _SYSTEM), structured-output schema _SameSubject (BaseModel: same_subject: bool), group_name="ledger_subject_judge"
- **Does:** Per-call user prompt supplying the shared token, the claim copy, and the brand evidence (each truncated to 400 chars), asking whether claim and evidence use this value for the SAME thing; returns structured output via the _SameSubject Pydantic model (same_subject: bool) -> True/False/None.

> Shared value/word: {token!r}\nCLAIM copy: {(claim_text or '')[:400]!r}\nBRAND evidence: {(evidence_text or '')[:400]!r}\nDo the claim and the evidence use this value for the SAME thing?
