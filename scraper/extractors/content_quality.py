"""Content quality extractor (PR-3).

Uses trafilatura to derive two signals per page:

  - `cleaned_main_text` — the article body with nav/footer/cookie-banner
    noise stripped. Useful for the LLM evidence-pack summary line and
    as a sanity check on the DOM walker. Persisted in the manifest so
    the build is reproducible (no need to re-import trafilatura at
    extraction time).

  - `has_meaningful_content` — True when the cleaned text is dense
    enough to feed a category/SWOT reasoning step. False means the
    page returned 200 OK but only carried scaffolding (cookies, nav,
    legal). The scraper-side `ScrapeDiagnostics.pages_with_text_blocks`
    count can then be honest about how many pages actually contributed
    information.

Design rules:
  - This module DOES NOT replace `scraper/extractors/text_blocks.py`.
    text_blocks runs in the browser via page.evaluate() and produces
    per-element evidence with bounding boxes — that's the validator's
    citation source. trafilatura runs on raw HTML in Python and produces
    one page-level paragraph stream. Both signals are kept.
  - Failures degrade gracefully. ImportError, parse errors, encoding
    issues, or empty input all return (None, False) — never raise.
  - Threshold values for `has_meaningful_content` are stored at module
    level so they can be tuned without touching call sites.
