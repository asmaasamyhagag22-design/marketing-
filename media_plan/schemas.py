"""U1 Media Plan — core schemas.

The Media Plan answers what the campaign defense actually asks: *what should this brand run, and
why?* Everything is grounded — a plan is only as trustworthy as its weakest evidence link.

Three design decisions the objective LIST forced (each a trap if left implicit):
1. A multi-objective list is NOT flat — it is a funnel with a budget split. So every
   `CampaignObjective` carries `funnel_stage` + `budget_allocation_pct`, and `MediaPlan` enforces
   the allocations SUM TO 100 (the silent-math-bug class this project fights).
2. Shared vs per-objective targeting lives at TWO levels: `MediaPlan.base_persona`/`base_geo` (who
   the brand talks to, generally) + each objective's optional `audience_refinement` (TOFU widens,
   BOFU narrows) — mirroring how a media buyer actually works, without repeating the persona N times.
3. A plan with ONE objective is fully valid, not an exception (a Nasr-City clinic = one LEADS
   objective, a complete single-stage funnel). The schema keeps the simple simple: `List[...]` of
   length 1 is natural, and its allocation auto-resolves to 100.

Rules (frozen, INTERFACES.md §F + the Prime Directives): PD-5 NEW models are STRICT
(`extra="forbid"`); PD-2 reuse `business_profile` `EvidenceItem`/`Confidence` (no fork); PD-4 no
network here (types the builder fills via the Caller / MockCaller); PD-8 `run_id` for traceability.
