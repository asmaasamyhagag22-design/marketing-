"""Shared brand-safety SCOPE for per-asset audit trails (Evidence-Ledger Step 3c).

ONE source of truth for the falsifiability POLICY + the product-level COVERAGE scoping, so
the poster trail and the content-calendar trail make the SAME honest statement about which
copy surfaces are gated and which are NOT. The reel is excluded until it is gated
(workstream #3) — claiming a brand-safety trail for an ungated surface is the overselling
that breaks the moat, so it stays named in `excluded_surfaces`.
