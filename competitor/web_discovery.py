"""SERP-based competitor discovery for ECOMMERCE / online businesses.

Implements the router's `WebDiscoveryEngine` Protocol. For businesses the Places
(LOCAL) path can't reach, it finds market peers via a pluggable web-search
provider (search_providers.py) and returns them as `CompetitorProfile` objects —
evidence-grounded exactly like the Places path:

  * Every peer carries the QUERY + organic RANK that surfaced it (SelectionRecord.
    why_selected), so "why this peer" is always answerable.
  * Only real, scrapable domains survive: social profiles (Facebook/Instagram/...)
    and aggregators/marketplaces/review-sites (Amazon, Yelp, Wikipedia, G2, ...)
    are dropped — they are not direct competitors.
  * The subject's own domain is excluded.

It NEVER fabricates a peer. No provider, an empty result, or an all-filtered
result yields [] and the SWOT layer degrades to a grounded standalone analysis.
