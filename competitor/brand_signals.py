"""Brand-level SWOT signals from the grounded business profile.

The mechanical gap matrix (matrix.py) sees a brand as page attributes — cta_count, whatsapp,
social_count. A strategist's SWOT leads with the BRAND: its distinctive promises and its proof.
Those signals already live in the profile (`value_propositions`, `trust_signals` — each a grounded
EvidencedField) but `synthesize_swot` threw them away. This module mines them into Strengths, every
line GATED by the same Evidence Ledger the rest of the pipeline uses (no free-form invention: a line
whose hard claims don't resolve to real evidence is DROPPED). Universal — keyed only off generic
profile fields that exist for every brand, never a vertical or brand name.
