"""Business-type classification: LOCAL / ECOMMERCE / HYBRID / REACH / UNKNOWN.

Pure and grounded — no network, no inference beyond the signals it exposes. The
discovery router (discovery.route_discovery) uses the verdict to pick an engine:
LOCAL -> Places, ECOMMERCE/REACH -> web engine, HYBRID -> both, UNKNOWN -> web.

Every result carries the `signals` that drove it, so the decision is traceable
(no hidden heuristics). Reads the real BusinessProfile shape but tolerates a
plain dict (model_dump) and missing fields.
