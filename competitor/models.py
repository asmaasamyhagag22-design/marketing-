"""Data models for competitor discovery and peer matching.

These types are deliberately decoupled from your `BusinessProfile`. The matching
engine operates only on `MatchCriteria` (a flat, explicit input) and `Candidate`
(what Places gives us). The single adapter that reads your real BusinessProfile
lives in `discovery.build_match_criteria` — that is the ONLY place that touches
your schema, so the engine stays pure and testable.
