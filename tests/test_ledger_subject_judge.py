"""C2 residual: the optional semantic same-subject judge for the Evidence Ledger.

The deterministic gate stays LENIENT (the project's designed number-only grounding) with NO
judge, so nothing regresses. An injected judge resolves the token-disjoint-subject ambiguity
— accepting synonyms / inflections ("5000 experts" <- "5000 youth", the Arabic pioneer
inflection) and rejecting fabrications ("100 gifts" <- "100 stores", "best coffee" <- "best
regards"). Any judge error -> lenient (never fabricate a rejection).

Hermetic: mock judge / mock caller, no network, no real LLM.
