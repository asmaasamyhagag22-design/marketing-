"""Vision photo-curation for the reel (reel.image_select) — FIX-D1 of the 2026-07-11 campaign.

The old implementation hard-required OPENAI_API_KEY (empty since the all-Gemini migration) and
silently kept EVERYTHING — the mechanism behind the screwdriver/banner/logo-wall reel. It now
runs on the shared Gemini caller and, with no caller (or a failed call), fails CLOSED through
the deterministic collage screen instead of keeping junk. Hermetic: injected fetch + caller.
