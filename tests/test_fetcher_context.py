"""The browser context must tolerate invalid TLS certs.

Origin (2026-07-06, owner live run): a real brand site (marasimltd.com) had an expired/misconfigured
cert, so Chromium refused it (net::ERR_CERT_AUTHORITY_INVALID) and the whole scrape returned 0 pages
in ~20s ("finished in 23 seconds and produced nothing"). We only READ public marketing content, so a
cert-authority error must NOT block the crawl. Hermetic: a fake browser records the context kwargs.
