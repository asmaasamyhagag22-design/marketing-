"""Baseera dashboard generator — hermetic (no network, no browser).

Verifies the self-contained HTML "prints everything" from the real artifact shapes: the brand,
KPIs, the CITED SWOT (with citations + claim-strength), the discovered competitors with their
peer-fit + why-selected, the TOWS strategies (title, not the empty 'text' field), and the
content calendar — and that it stays self-contained (no external CDN/font links).
