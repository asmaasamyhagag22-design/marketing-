"""Evidence Ledger — a WEB-tier claim is proof only when its source is REPUTABLE.

The moat is *provable* grounding. A hard claim backed only by a search snippet from an
aggregator / listicle / junk-SEO host (g2.com, similarweb.com, crunchbase.com …) is NOT
proof — anyone can seed those. This gate used to live only in poster/pick_angle, so the
SAME junk snippet could still "verify" a claim in the concept / calendar / TOWS / reel
paths. The reputability filter now runs at ledger-BUILD time (in `from_profile.add`), so
every gate that resolves against the ledger inherits it.

Contract pinned here (no live LLM / network):
  * a web fact sourced only by an aggregator host  -> UNSOURCED (dropped at build)
  * the same web fact sourced by a reputable outlet -> SOURCED, tier == "web"
  * brand-tier evidence (the brand's OWN site) is ALWAYS kept, url or not
  * a web fact with NO url is kept (can't judge a missing host -> don't over-drop)
  * the standalone `is_reputable_web_source(url)` predicate itself
