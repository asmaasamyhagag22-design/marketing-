"""SWOT phrasing (competitor/brand_signals.phrase_dimension + _standalone_from_subject).

Origin (owner): even the mechanical lines read like a raw attribute dump — "Number of CTAs: 3",
"Online booking: not detected on site". Slice 2 re-phrases the SAME scrape-grounded cell into
strategist language ("Clear conversion paths (3 calls-to-action)", "No WhatsApp contact channel")
without touching its citation / evidence / claim_strength. Hermetic: no network, no LLM.
